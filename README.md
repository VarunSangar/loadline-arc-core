# loadline-arc-core
Loadline ARC is a non-diagnostic neurotechnology prototype designed to help individuals recognize cognitive strain, fatigue, and overload in real time. ARC integrates EEG signal processing, context awareness, and adaptive feedback to promote healthier focus habits — without replacing human judgment or clinical care.
ARC is designed to pair with the existing Loadline platform, which already tracks CLI (Cognitive Load Index) via behavioral inputs. Together, the Loadline ecosystem connects internal neural signals with external performance patterns.
